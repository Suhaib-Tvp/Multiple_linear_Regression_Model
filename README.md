# Multiple Linear Regression Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of Multiple Linear Regression to analyze and predict dependent variables based on multiple independent variables. The Jupyter Notebook walks through the entire process from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Project Contents
- `multiple_linear_regression_project.ipynb` - Main notebook containing the project implementation.
- `data/` - Directory containing the dataset (if applicable).
- `README.md` - Documentation for the project.

## Installation
To set up the necessary environment, install the following dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook multiple_linear_regression_project.ipynb
   ```
2. Execute the cells step by step to follow the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Building and training a Multiple Linear Regression model
- Performance evaluation using R-squared and MSE
- Data visualization with graphs and charts

## Results & Insights
The project presents findings on how multiple factors contribute to the prediction of the dependent variable using regression analysis.

## License
This project is open-source and can be used for educational purposes.
